# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe AI Game repository! This project features a classic Tic Tac Toe game where players can compete against an intelligent AI opponent. The game logic is built using Python, implementing the Minimax algorithm to ensure optimal moves for the AI, while a graphical user interface (GUI) is created with Pygame for an engaging user experience.
